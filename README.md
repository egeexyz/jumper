A basic platformer game written with [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io/) **2.0** to demonstrate basic game functions. It is a spirtual fork of the original PhaserJS 2.0 tutorial when it was first released. Watch how I built it on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/88DS3Z8nOdY).

## Getting Started

This repository is configured to be as simple as possible; build, deploy, and play with all with **npm**.

First, clone or download this repository and run `npm install`.

There are a few ways to run Jumper:

- Run `npm start` and the game window should appear.
- Run `npm start` and go to `localhost:8080` in a web browser.
- Run `docker-compose` and go to `localhost:8080` in a web browser. (requires Docker & Docker-Compose to be installed.)
